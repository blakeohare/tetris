# Blake's Tetris Reference

Whenever I learn a new programming language, I first try to write tetris in it. These also usually involve some basic level of game-oriented UI work and so it serves as a good crash course that I can force myself through since it's less trivial than "Hello World". Since these aren't all languages I use frequently, by having these, I can refer to the language syntax later (in addition to how to create a graphical window). I also periodically add languages I use frequently just for completion.
